# YouTube Metadata Extractor

This is a simple metadata extractor for YouTube videos; useful for OSINT investigations and data recollection. This simple code was originally inspired by the now defunct [YouTube Data Viewer](https://citizenevidence.org/2014/07/01/youtube-dataviewer/) published by Amnesty International. 

# Instructions

1. Download the `youtube_extractor.py` file.
2. Create a YouTube API key. [See instructions](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).
3. Open the code and on line 16, replace the part that contains `[REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY]` with your personal API key, and save it. 
4. Run the code using `python3 youtube_extractor.py` in the terminal. 
5. Enter an URL of a YouTube video and see the output.
